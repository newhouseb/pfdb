# PFDB - printf debugger

Ever find yourself logging obscene amounts of data to the console when you're debugging some fancy algorithm? Sometimes debuggers aren't what you need or sometimes debuggers just don't exist for whatever environment you're working in. PFDB is like a time machine for logging. It allows you to log variables as they change and then independently browse through a history of each variable and correlate each change with other log variables and statements.

Currently a work in progress.
